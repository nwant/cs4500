Background:
-----------
This goal of this project was to design an application that would help Dr. Michael Lemke and his collegues better understand some of the research data compiled from the Emiquon Project over the course of several years.

Dr. Lemke provided several datasets for our team to reference and use in our application. Each dataset provided contained measurements from samples taken from 3 different sites and periodic dates (approximately every 1-2 weeks) over the course of several years.

cs4500
--------

This file is an outline of everything inside of the cs4500 master folder.  The contents of each folder will be described here as well as basic information regarding the files.  If you want more detailed information involving the contents of the files, comments can be found inside the files themselves.

Contains the files for client and server, as well as the configuration object to configure the application.

Files inside of main:
•	config.R

•	server.R.orig
•	ui.R

These files control the server and client, as well as produce the user-interface(ui) and the configuration for the application.

test/data
--------------

Contains files that conduct unit test on the functions inside of the project

Files inside of test/data:
•	test.filter.r
These files mirror the main file structure of the project.  All test files are named 
test.<regular file name>.R
 where <regular file name> would be the name of the file that the test file is testing. 
e.g. : test.filter.R would be the test file for unit test pertaining to filter.R file
