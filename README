File Stucture
================================

* `data/` - Defines functions that handle data processing.
* `data/repo.R` - Defines `get.all`, which loads the arisa and ciliate data into a data.table.
* `data/blur.R` - Defines `filter.blur`, which adds each row into adjacent rows, weighted by the gaussian function. This shows the correlation resulting from effects that may have a delay.
* `data/filter.R` - Defines `filter.all.data`, which removes rows from the data.table based on the input parameters.
* `docs/` - Documentation for installing, running, deploying, and using the program.
* `source/` - Holds source csv files.
* `source/ARISA.CSV` - Arisa data.
* `source/CILIATES_1.CSV`, `source/CILIATES_2.CSV` - Ciliates data.
* `test/data/` - Defines unit tests. Each test should test exactly one source file, named `test.<source_file_name>`.
* `config.R` - Configuration file. Holds parameters for tuning the visualization.
* `ui.R` - Defines the user interface. Controls are configured in this file.
* `server.R` - Main endpoint that calls repo, blur, and filter.
* `install.R` - Stand-alone script that installs the necessary R packages.
* `run.R` - Starts the server and opens a browswer window for the client.
* `deploy.R` - Uploads the application to https://shinyapps.io.

Design Rationale
=============================================
One of our goals in designing this application was to enable future teams to be able to extend the application, as well as configure in one place without having to modify much of the code (see "File Structure" section above for more details).
Configuration to the application can be achieved by modifying the config.R file in the main folder. Each folder has is desginated for a specific function, and all files reference other files using relative paths. In this way, the application files/folders can be placed anyone on a client or server machine and no other changes will need to be made so long as the file structure is as indicated by the File Structure section above.
